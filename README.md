# Fourfronts Repository

This is the repo for frontend and backend of the app.

## Frontend
You will need the latest version of angular cli

```shell
npm i -g @angluar/cli
```

in `/frontend/` run `npm i` to install and  `ng serve` to run.

## Backend
You need to provide a `.env` for the project. Currently the project is setup to use port 5000 for the backend.

```yaml
ACCESS_TOKEN_SECRET=
REFRESH_TOKEN_SECRET=
MONGODB_URL=
PORT=5000
```

Genearte secrets for tokens and refreshtokens as you please.
For mongodb register an account and a cluster at (MongoDB Atlas)[https://www.mongodb.com/] or ask me for my cluster.

## Login and enjoy!
